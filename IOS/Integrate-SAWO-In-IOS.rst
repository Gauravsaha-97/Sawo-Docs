Integrate SAWO in iOS
=====================

iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware.

Let's get our iOS App running with SAWO
=======================================

Integration of SAWO in iOS doesn't require any additional requirements. So, we will move on to the steps.

Steps
-----

We need to follow a few steps to get SAWO integrated into our application.

1. As the first step to getting our iOS App to run with SAWO login, we need an essential component, which is the “SAWO API key”. You are probably wondering where we can get these, right? For that, we have to create a project in the SAWO Dashboard, where we can go directly by clicking `here <https://dev.sawolabs.com/>`__.

1.1 Click the “create new project” button. Choose the platform on which we will create our project, where we will be able to see the code beforehand. In this case, it will be “iOS” as we are creating it on iOS. Click continue.

1.2 Next, give the name of your project. In the “Enter your hostname” section, leave it empty because we will talk about it afterwards. Now, click “create”. There we are. We currently have a project in the SAWO dashboard.

1.3 Now, we can see in the project section the display of details about our project. Open notepad and copy the “API key” because we will need it afterwards.

2. Once we create our project, we would need to set our hostname.

2.1 For development in a local machine, the hostname should be set to 'localhost'. So, write localhost beside the hostname and click "save". 

     - If using ''localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1"

2.2 For production, the hostname should be set to your domain.

     - If you are adding your domain, do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash. Example: We should keep https://dev.sawolabs.com/ as dev.sawolabs.com
