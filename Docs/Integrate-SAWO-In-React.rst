Integrate SAWO in React
=======================

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. Facebook maintains it. We can build several practical applications through this library.

Let's get our React App running with SAWO
==========================================

To get our app running, we need to have a few things installed.

Requirements
------------

Node [Version 12.x+ ], Node Package Manager (NPM) [Version 6.x+]

Let's move on to the steps.

Steps
-----

We need to follow a few steps to get SAWO integrated into our application.

1. As the first step to getting our HTML to run with SAWO login, we need an essential component, which is the “SAWO API key”. You are probably wondering where we can get these, right? For that, we have to create a project in the SAWO Dashboard, where you can go directly by clicking `here <https://dev.sawolabs.com/>`__.

1.1 Click the “create new project” button. Choose the platform on which you will create your project where you will be able to see the code beforehand. In this case, it will be “web” as we are creating it on HTML.
