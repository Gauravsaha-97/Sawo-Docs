# Submission Guide for Documentations

This document will give an overview on how the submission procedure will work for any given technical documentation.

# Getting Started

To get started with the submission process, firstly, fork the "Sawo-Docs" Repository in your local or personal GitHub account. You can fork the repository by simply clicking on the "fork button" beside "star" which is available at the right hand corner of the page. After clicking on the Fork button, you will be prompted to fork Sawo-Docs repository in your personal GitHub account.

Click your account name in the dialogue box, which will fork the repository in your personal account.

Make a directory by clicking on the "Add file" button followed by clicking on the "Create new file" option. In the naming section, add an appropriate name of the folder followed by slash ("/"). This will create another file, which will be the main documentation file. The documentation file must be a markdown file (.md).

After naming the file, scroll down and click on "Commit New File", which will create the new file. Add contents in the file by clicking on the "Pencil Icon" in the right hand corner. This will allow you to open the editing interface and will enable you to make further commits.

Create the tech documentation guide by following the SAWO template, which you will find by clicking [here](https://github.com/Sawo-Community/Sawo-Docs/blob/main/Template-for-Guides/README.md).

# Opening a Pull Request

After you have done the necessary changes, you will be able to open a Pull Request or PR. To open a PR with all of your changes at once, click on the "Contrbute" tab in the forked repository of yours. There, you will be prompted to open a pull request. Click on the "Open Pull Request" button.

Once you have given a proper title and description of the PR, again click on "Create Pull Request". This will officially create a Pull Request for the Sawo-Docs repository. You can now check your PR at the Pull Request section of the main repository.

# Naming and Describing a PR

Give an appropiate title of the Pull Request which will resonate with your technical documentation. After naming, give a brief and proper description of the technical documentation which will help our team of reviewers and maintainers to understand and review the document in a quick manner.
