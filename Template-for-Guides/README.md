# Template for making Guides

This markdown will be a basic sample indicating the walkthrough on creating any guide for SAWO Labs.

# What are Guides?

Guides are simple instructions which will help any person to have a hands-on walkthrough to develop any new things. The set of instructions must be crisp and to the point.

# Template

*Below is a given template, which you will use for creating any guide for SAWO.*

---------------------------------------

# {Enter the title of the content}
  
The "hash symbol" in markdown is used for defining a title. After defining the title, add a very short description which will mention a little bit about the technology and the content, which you will be creating.

Add any relevant links which you think might be feasble in the document. To add a link in a markdown document, simply follow this syntax: [Google](https://www.google.com). To view the syntax, go to the editing interface by clicking the "Pencil Icon" in the right hand corner.

# Requirements

In this section, mention any requirements that might be needed before getting started with the walkthrough. If something needs to be installed, mention that properly. You have to add code blocks mentioning the command required in the terminal to install a particular package.

To add a code block, use the below syntax:
```sh
code-block
```
Copy the segment from row 22 to 24, and replace "code-block" with the appropiate code. To copy, select the "Pencil icon" in the right hand corner. It will open the editing interface from where you will be able to copy the things you need.

# Get Started

In this segment, index all the steps required for the guide. 

## 0. {Enter a title of the step}

After this, very briefly describe the step and add any relevant code blocks. Give a link to a GitHub code under the *0th Step*, so that the audience can follow along. You can add titles according to your wish. Popular examples are "Get the Template Code", "Have a look at the code", etc.

An additional "hash symbol" identifies the secondary headings inside the primary heading.

Repeat this process, until you are done with the steps. Index all of the steps as shown above. Add pictures along with code blocks if necessary. To add a picture, use the following syntax as shown below:

![Sawo Dashboard](https://github.com/Sawo-Community/Sawo-Docs/blob/main/images/SAWO%201.png)

The text inside the third bracket after the "exclamation" tells the description of the image. Inside the first bracket, lies the path of the image. A path is an URL where the image is originally located. You will get to see the syntax in the *editing interface*.

If you feel the need to sub index the contents under any step, feel free to do that by using bullets or numbers.

## {Last step serial no.} Conclusion

In the description of this step, add an upbeat congratulatory message which will commence the end of the guide. You can add, "Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial." If you have recorded a demo video of the walkthrough, add that through a single line in this step. A popular line will be, "Here's a [working demo](https://www.youtube.com) of the tutorial we just went over."

# What's Next?

In this section, mention some of the popular tech stacks that are already available, through which we can use SAWO authentication in our project.

--------------------------------

This marks the end of the template. Use this template to write a tech documentation guide for any integration with SAWO.

Submit your technical documentation according to the official submission guide of SAWO, which you can access by clicking [here](https://github.com/Sawo-Community/Sawo-Docs/blob/main/Template-for-Guides/Submission-Guide.md).
